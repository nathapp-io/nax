## Hooks

Integrate notifications, CI triggers, or custom scripts via lifecycle hooks.

**Project hooks** (`.nax/hooks.json`):

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "on-complete": {
      "command": "openclaw system event --text 'Feature done!'",
      "enabled": true
    },
    "on-pause": {
      "command": "bash hooks/notify.sh",
      "enabled": true
    }
  }
}
```

**Available events:**

| Event | Fires when |
|:------|:-----------|
| `on-start` | Run begins |
| `on-story-start` | A story starts processing |
| `on-story-complete` | A story passes all checks |
| `on-story-fail` | A story exhausts all retry attempts |
| `on-pause` | Run paused (awaiting human input) |
| `on-resume` | Run resumed after pause |
| `on-session-end` | An agent session ends (per-session teardown) |
| `on-all-stories-complete` | All stories passed — regression gate pending *(v0.34.0)* |
| `on-final-regression-fail` | Deferred regression failed after rectification *(v0.34.0)* |
| `on-complete` | Everything finished and verified (including regression gate) |
| `on-error` | Unhandled error terminates the run |

**Hook lifecycle:**

```
on-start
  └─ on-story-start → on-story-complete (or on-story-fail)  ← per story
       └─ on-all-stories-complete                            ← all stories done
            └─ deferred regression gate (if enabled)
                 └─ on-final-regression-fail                 ← if regression fails
       └─ on-complete                                        ← everything verified
```

Each hook receives context via `NAX_*` environment variables and full JSON on stdin.

**Environment variables passed to hooks:**

| Variable | Description |
|:---------|:------------|
| `NAX_EVENT` | Event name (e.g., `on-story-complete`) |
| `NAX_FEATURE` | Feature name |
| `NAX_STORY_ID` | Current story ID (if applicable) |
| `NAX_STATUS` | Status (`pass`, `fail`, `paused`, `error`) |
| `NAX_REASON` | Reason for pause or error |
| `NAX_COST` | Accumulated cost in USD |
| `NAX_MODEL` | Current model |
| `NAX_AGENT` | Current agent |
| `NAX_ITERATION` | Current iteration number |

**Global vs project hooks:** Global hooks (`~/.nax/hooks.json`) fire alongside project hooks. Set `"skipGlobal": true` in your project `hooks.json` to disable global hooks.
